# [SASS Variables](https://sass-lang.com/guide/#variables)

> Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think youâ€™ll want to reuse. Sass uses the $ symbol to make something a variable.

```scss
  $primary: #fafafa;
  color: $primary;
```

## Example

`_variable.scss` is the simple implement of variable in sass. Run the command below:

```cmd
sass --watch _variables.scss style.css
```
