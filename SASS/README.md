# Learn SASS

Setting Up Development Environment
To work with SASS that needed to set up the environment:

- Install Node.js: Download and install from [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Install SASS: Run `npm install -g sass` in the terminal for running sass global

- `sass --watch scss:css` to automatically compile your SASS files to CSS whenever they change.

## [CSS Preprocessing](https://sass-lang.com/guide/#preprocessing)

>CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help. Sass has features that donâ€™t exist in CSS yet like nesting, mixins, inheritance, and other nifty goodies that help you write robust, maintainable CSS.
