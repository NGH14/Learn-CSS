# Learn SASS

Setting Up Development Environment
To work with SASS that needed to set up the environment:

- Install Node.js: Download and install from [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Install SASS: Run `npm install -g sass` in the terminal for running sass global

- `sass --watch scss:css` to automatically compile your SASS files to CSS whenever they change.

## Sample Project Structure

```bash
  project/
  ├── scss/
  │   └── main.scss
  │   └──...
  └── css/
```
